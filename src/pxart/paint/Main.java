/*
 * This is a simple image editor optimized for making pixel art.
 * The reason I made this is because I wanted a simple, lightweight editor for making pixel art 
 * for my games. This editor cannot be compared to programs like Photoshop or Gimp, this app
 * only has basic features which are useful for making low-res pixel art.
 * I made this project somewhere in late August 2023 when I was 16
